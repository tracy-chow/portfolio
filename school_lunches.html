        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Brooklyn Friends School is a school with 5 divisions (family center, preschool, lower school, middle school, and upper school) and approximately 950 students. After observing the complicated workflow for ordering lunch, I initiated the following optimization project so that teachers could focus on teaching and the chefs could focus on cooking rather than spending multiple hours each week chasing, collecting, and tabulating orders. My role was to design and streamline a lunch ordering &amp; delivery system for the 3rd &amp; 4th grade students that was later scaled to other divisions and campuses.</p>
        <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:80%">
          <div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6366b8e600010399c4e62143/63c0ed5363fad47614bc3b50_Dip%20Dip.png" loading="lazy" alt="Timeline, Tools, Roles &amp; Teams"></div>

        <p>&zwj;</p>
        <h3>1. Problem</h3>
        <p>Because of the COVID&nbsp;pandemic, teachers &amp; students were no longer allowed to select and eat lunch in the school cafeteria. The school required a lunch ordering &amp; delivery system for students in the lower school but did not have the budget to purchase a 3rd-party app. The initial solution by the culinary team was to manually collect and tabulate the daily orders.</p>
        <p>My goal was to streamline the ordering &amp; delivery workflow, reduce the errors in order collection, and ensure lunches were prepared and delivered to the intended diners.</p>
        <p>&zwj;</p>
        <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:">
          <div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6366b8e600010399c4e62143/6379f95bace033c08f1da204_IMG_20171020_105459186_HDR-1028x660.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="School Salad Bar"></div>
        </figure>
        <p>&zwj;</p>
        <h3>2. Solutions &amp; Results</h3>
        <p>Collaborating with stakeholders &amp; end users, I designed an online form for students as young as 8 years old to independently select their lunches in a safe and timely manner with their orders accurately tabulated for the culinary team and classroom teachers.</p>
        <p>This new system reduced the culinary team’s work by 99.4% within the first 30 days, saved the school 100% on the cost of purchasing a 3rd-party app, and significantly reduced food waste.</p>
        <p>&zwj;</p>
        <h2>Users &amp;&nbsp;Stakeholders</h2>
        <h3>1. Target Audience</h3>
        <p>• Initial Product: Brooklyn Friends School Lower Division: 3rd &amp;&nbsp;4th Grade Students and Teachers</p>
        <p>• Scaled Up: Brooklyn Friends School Family Center: Nursery School Teachers</p>
        <p>&zwj;</p>
        <h3>2. Understanding the Stakeholders</h3>
        <p>&zwj;</p>

        </figure>
        <p>&zwj;</p>
        <h3>3. Participatory Design Process</h3>
        <p>End-users were consulted at each step of the process. This included not only the primary stakeholders but also anyone who may have been affected by the usage of the system. Because of the urgency of the situation and the inflexible time constraints, an agile approach was taken but sprints were sometimes shortened to one week.</p>
        <p>&zwj;</p>
        <h3>4. Interviews &amp;&nbsp;Findings</h3>
        <p>During the ideation phase of the project, I conducted user interviews to build new personas and to inform the design. Within one week, a total of 16 users were interviewed with a focus on their motivations and pain points. The objective was to streamline their workflows:</p>
        <p>· 1:1 Interview with Head Chef</p>
        <p>· 1:2 Interviews with Teaching Pairs (6 pairs were interviewed)</p>
        <p>· 1:1 Interviews with Families (3 parents were interviewed)</p>

        <h2>User Personas </h2>
        <p>I wanted to form a deeper understanding of our users' goals, needs, experiences, and behaviors, so five personas for each of the user segments were created. They were based on user interviews, observations, and digital communication. We kept updating them throughout the project as we more data was gathered. We used these personas whenever we wanted to step out of ourselves and reconsider our initial ideas. We also looked for opportunities to make smart tradeoffs.</p>
        <p>Aside from their motivations &amp; pain points, we added four additional categories: technical proficiency, time available for task, stakeholder accountability, and stakeholder's agency.</p>

        <h2>User Journey Maps &amp;&nbsp;User Requirements</h2>
        <p>User journey maps were created to build a better understanding of how users ordered lunch and how the culinary team collected and used the data to discover opportunities for improvement. The map revealed many user problems and opportunities at the ordering stages of the user journey. In particular, users with the most time available (i.e., students) to complete the ordering task were given the least amount of agency over their lunch orders. Therefore, we paid special attention to these stages during the design process.</p>

        <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
        <h3>1. Methodology: Natural User Observations with Behavior Tracking</h3>
        <p>Due to the urgent need of the tool by all stakeholders, usability testing was conducted over different iterations of the fully-functional prototypes made in Forms. Initial testing only involved the target audience (i.e., students). Several third grade students were observed remotely during the ordering process to determine whether the UI was too difficult for them to navigate on their own without the intervention of a teacher. Students were provided with approximately 5 minutes to complete the task.</p>

        <h3>2. Research Questions</h3>
        <p>• Will a child/student between the ages of 8 and 10 be able to choose something on the menu for each day of the school week? </p>
        <p>• How long would that take?</p>
        <p>• How often do students request help from a teacher, a peer, or an adult when ordering lunch?</p>
        <p>• Would adults feel more or less confident in allowing their children to pick their food items with a built-in allergy setting?</p>
        <p>&zwj;</p>
        <h3>3. Participants</h3>
        <p>Due to time constraints, only third graders were observed as they were the youngest end-users and the assumption was that older students would be at least as capable as the youngest students. Three students (two females and one male) were asked to order lunch on their own without any assistance in an unmoderated task for the first iteration of the form. Students were observed remotely but an adult was nearby (in-person) for assistance. In a UX research study with more time, both age groups would be observed to determine any biases my assumptions above may have caused. </p>
        <p>&zwj;</p>
        <p>In addition, exploring the data from the SSO's data analytics dashboard and the Google dashboard as a super administrator for Google Workspace for Education, I was able to gain some rough insights on how long students took to submit their orders and whether it was done successfully as indicated on the output spreadsheet from the Google Form. Had there been more time, eye-tracking studies would enable more specific generalizations or insights about the design &amp; layout of the UI.</p>
        <p>As we decided to scale the process to include teachers being able to order as well as faculty from a second campus, subjects were added to subsequent usability testing.</p>

        <h2>UI&nbsp;Design Notes</h2>
        <p>To attract student's attention, forms were automatically pushed out through the student SSO every Thursday morning with custom animated GIFs created by myself or with students. Colors and fonts set in the school's branding guidelines were used ensure a cohesive aesthetic with the student portal and school website. Large fonts with high contrast and simply worded menus were created but the forms themselves were not changed to facilitate the navigation of students through the order form with as little adult-intervention as possible. As several students were known to have color blindness, designs were checked with online apps (e.g., <a href="https://accessibe.com/accessscan">accessScan</a>) to ensure they met accessibility compliance. Since each student was provided a tablet Chromebook, designs were created with Chromebooks in mind. However, because Google's products are inherently responsive, users could access both the order forms and the delivery lists on both mobile and desktop devices. </p>

        <p>&zwj;</p>
        <p>As students were given only 5 minutes to put their orders through on Thursday mornings, steps had to be simplified with minimum typing needed as the younger students were still learning how to type. Although food allergies were matched up with student orders on the backend, students were not made aware of this and were always asked to indicate their allergies. Because <strong>we wanted this to be a learning opportunity</strong>, students who repeatedly "forgot" to indicate their food allergies were flagged and their teachers had a private conversation with them that they, too, have a responsibility to keep themselves healthy by learning and advocating for their own food safety.</p>

        <h2>Outcomes &amp;&nbsp;Impact</h2>
        <h3>1. Redesigned Workflow</h3>
        <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2036pxpx">

        <p>&zwj;</p>
        <h3>2. Deliverables</h3>
        <p>I automated lunch ordering &amp; deliveries for nearly 200 diners after scaling up to 2 campuses by automating &amp; simplifying the process. The new system reduced time spent on logistics by 99.4% in the first 30 days for the culinary team and teachers, ensured accurate deliveries, raised the integrity of allergy alerts to 100%, and saved 100% on cost of a 3rd-party app. In addition, it empowered students to voice their needs (i.e., allergies, special dietary needs, etc) and to take responsibility over their own food choices in a safe environment. This resulted in very happy stakeholders, from students, teachers, families, and the culinary team.</p>
        <p>&zwj;</p>

          <figcaption>Simplifying the digital process led to simplification of the physical ones too!</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>&zwj;</p>
        <h3>3. Learnings</h3>
        <p>Balancing the competing demands and assessing the value of added features over the time needed to complete them was initially challenging. It required talking to the end-users and determining what should be completed first in the backlog and then saying "no" or "not yet" to the rest. An impact-effort matrix was useful in determining which were incremental features, which would be easy-wins, and which would not worth the time or the effort. By evaluating proposed features in an objective way, I was able to get the system out sooner and to benefit the largest number of users.</p>
        <p>Rebalancing the workload so that it gave students more agency over their food choices actually worked out better than expected. Though the youngest students in the group were only 8 years old, most of them were very responsible about indicating their food allergies. Giving them the training wheels to do so at such an early age was scary for many families, especially during the pandemic. However, their fears were assuaged with the hidden allergy alerts and students rose to the occasion. As teachers and guardians, we may need to rethink how much we underestimate our students and children. Because students had a choice over what they ate, they were more likely to eat their lunches. Moreover, teachers and the culinary team had more time to attend to other tasks, like teaching and making healthy lunches for students!</p>
        <p>&zwj;</p>
        <h2>Takeaways &amp; Next Steps</h2>
        <p>Scaling up to other divisions would be an eventual next step for this tool since it was successfully scaled to the nursery school (family center) teachers. Though the culinary team did want to scale this up, I had already left the school, and they weren't able to find anyone who was able to modify the SQL queries as the needs changed for users of the other divisions within the school. However, they were able to continue using it for the divisions the tool was designed for.</p>
